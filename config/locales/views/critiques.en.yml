          A critique is a genre of journalism and art criticism
          that contains a short critical evaluation and (optionally)
          a rating of some work.

          It's very important that we can properly describe our impressions
          and thoughts and thusly inform other users about the quality of
          %{kind}. Also there are some unspoken rules that might help you
          to write a valuable critique that you won't feel ashamed of once you
          decide to show it to other people.

          [*] Watching. First of all try to watch anime in high quality
          either with good dubbing or subtitles
          (the latter will give you an opportunity to evaluate seiyuus'
          performance that might become a revelation for those
          who are used to dubbed anime).

          [*] Introduction. Tell about the reasons why you have
          decided to write this critique, what has inspired you to
          share your impressions. Or what part of anime or manga
          stands out from the rest. This is the pivot of your critique.
          You can right away refer to the plot, direction,
          special effects or some general idea of producer or mangaka.

          [*] Peculiarities. You can describe best moments or characteristic
          features of anime or manga characters. Or else you can compare
          similar works, give your interpretation of the plot,
          criticize OST and much more.

          [*] Conclusion. Do you like this anime as a whole?
          Is it worth watching? Sum up your thoughts about this anime
          and evaluate the work of anime producer. Give your verdict.

          [*] Try not to make spoilers - no one likes spoilers.
          [*] Try to divide your critique into paragraphs devoted to
          specific topics.
